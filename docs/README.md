- With this design I wanted to steer towards a more minimalistic approach. 
- As this is a mirror the most often times the user would utilize this interface is in the morning, waking up, and the evening, going to bed, both times when a user is likely to be tired, and thus unlikely to want to have to much information presented to them.
- Thus, most information is behind simple to access tabs so that the user can chose to what information they want. 
- Additionally, I placed all interactable content to wards the lower 3rd of the interface as to not need users to strain to reach elements.
- I placed the date, time, and weather information towards the top of the interface as it is unlikely to need to be interacted with.
